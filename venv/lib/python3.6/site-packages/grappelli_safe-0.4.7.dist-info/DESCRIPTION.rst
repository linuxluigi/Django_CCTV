Overview
========

grappelli_safe is a permanent fork of 
`Grappelli admin skin <http://code.google.com/p/django-grappelli/>`_ for 
`Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, to be referenced as a 
dependency for the `Mezzanine CMS for Django <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/>`_.

At the time of grappelli_safe's creation, Grappelli was incorrectly 
packaged on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_, and had also dropped 
compatibility with Django 1.1 -- grappelli_safe was therefore created to 
address these specific issues.

For further details, see 
`Why are Grappelli and Filebrowser Forked? <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/docs/frequently-asked-questions.html#grappelli-filebrowser-forks>`_.
